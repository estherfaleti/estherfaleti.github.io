    <h1> HOMUNCULI </h1>
</head>
 <p> A Homunculus (人造人間ホムンクルス)prononnunced as Homunkurusu which is the Latin word for "Little Human", Japanese for "Artificial Human"). This is a refrence t the medieval concept of an artificially created human. In this case the way that the humuncluli are created with the use of alchemy. presumably brought into existence by certain means of alchemy. 

Though a common concept, well known and understood by alchemists in Amestris, the idea of the Homunculus is regarded as no more than a farce or faraway fantasy as no individual or group of alchemists has come anywhere close to successfully creating such a being in officially recorded history. Even so, alchemists have been forbidden by the Amestrian government to attempt or research the transmutation of humans and State Alchemists have such a restriction as part of their creed. The seven key Homunculi created in the series are referred to as the "Sins"<p/>
